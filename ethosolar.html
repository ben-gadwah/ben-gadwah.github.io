                  <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p class="content-col">EthoSolar was in need of a new website with it's brand adjustment. Instead of putting a new skin on the old site and all of it's content, I was able to dive into the user experience and deliver an experience better than before. The new branding also helped the design to follow best practices for web and user interface.</p>

                  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                      <p class="content-col">At the time when I was researching for this project companies like SunRun, Vivint, and SolarCity had already been launching newly branded material. SunRun launched a new site with similar business goals as EthoSolar, with simple colors and illustrations, flow, and target market. EthoSolar's business goals were to educate customers about the benefits of solar. The business's tools and knowledge would be a key sales approach.</p>

                  <h2>Journey Map</h2>
                    <p class="content-col">A few things about the old site that made sense why visitors were not submitting any of the forms or staying on the site for very long:
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>Big, scary form at the bottom of every page asking for name, email, address, and current utility bill.</li>
                      <li>Unclear navigation, especially when the site would load Canadian content to US visitors.</li>
                      <li>Not enough educational pieces, hard to find.</li>
                      <li>Boring brand with same old solar photos, lack of visual identity.</li>
                      <li>Information Architecture didn't make sense, a lot of different pages showcased the same information</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p class="content-col">To understand the old site better I drew out the current flow of the site and took a few notes... Ok, I took a lot of notes. There was a lot going on, but nothing very useful. The experience was very overwhelming and putting it to paper helped me to see why.</p>

                    <p class="content-col">There was a lot of features we wanted to add to the new site. Unfortunately time was not on our side, and it would go against basic design principles to launch a site with every feature we could dream up and the developer could magic up after a few cups of coffee. Our ideas were written out on cards and sorted by category. From there we picked the ones that made the most sense and went with our goal of offering visitors the ability to calculate how much a solar installation would cost them, save them in the long run, and also general information about the overall benefits of solar.</p>

                  <p class="content-col">While building this website it was key to develop a brand visual identity. Other companies were putting out illustrations, infographics, and the same stock photos of solar panels. It was important to decide what sort of voice the brand would have. I started the brand development early in the redesign process to help the rest of the project fall into place. The structure of the site would follow the content and visual identity.</p>

We finished the site on time and with it an imbound marketing system that was bringing in leads from social media and email. We started seeing more click throughs on our landing pages and our solar calculator leading to forms being completed for new sales prospects.
